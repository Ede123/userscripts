# About
**_OpenSubtitles Direct Downloads_** converts all download links for subtitles found on  [**OpenSubtitles**](http://www.opensubtitles.org/) into direct download links.

Therefore this user script
- makes it unnecessary to untick _"Use OpenSubtitles Download Manager"_ before a subtitle download.
- bypasses the advertising site normally shown.
