#About
**_AMO Editors_** adds some additional functionality for editors on [**addons.mozilla.org (AMO)**](https://addons.mozilla.org/).

Currently these are
- Add a "Review" button to add-on listings to quickly change to the review page of an add-on.
- Automatically pre-fill the "tested on" field in review resolution with information extracted from the current user agent.
- Make the file viewer use the full width of the browser window to avoid line-breaks whenever possible

**Important Note:**
This script is *only* useful for AMO editors (the people who review add-on submissions to addons.mozilla.org).
If you're not an AMO editor don't bother to install it!
